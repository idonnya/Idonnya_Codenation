<div><h2>Outcome 1.1 - Describe the purpose of IT in modern business</h2></div>
<br>
<p>There are a variety of uses and purpose of IT in modern buisness. The role of IT may be influenced by the sector of the highlighted business. For example, its role may be to improve customer service, increase/facilitate the attainment of sales targets or improve the function of a business.  Therefore, a business' objective must be clearly defined and the use of IT must be carefully tailored to aide in the objective. To illustrate, research conducted by Accenture in 2014 reported that 71% of companies surveyed found the IT department as the predominant driver for innovation.   </p>

<div><h2>Outcome 1.2 - Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully </h2></div>
<br>
<p>The methods required to complete a digital project include research the objective of the project and how it may be delivered. For example if one was to deliver a website for a client, we would have to conduct relevant research on the platform(s) of choice etc HTML and/or CSS, how to incorporate important information, the visual representation and the way to achieve that via the code. Those involved in the project would also need to be capable of identifying problems and solving them as and when they occur e.g. debugging code or clarifying the client's concept.
The skills needed included the ability to be adaptable and to implement the customer's wish via written code. These include being proficient in the programming language of choice, clear communication and ability to execute the plan according to specific deadlines. 
The resources include wifi, a laptop and/or desktop, access to research material e.g. books, internet, and ability to communicate. To illustrate, the methods, skills and resources are all related. To clearly implement a method or demonstrate a skill one must first use specific resources available such as researching how to perform the task, using a laptop/wifi to execute the task to then deliver the project for the client/relevant party.
<br>
<div><h2>Outcome 1.3 - Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website </h2></div>
<br>
<p>
Trello with the KanBan modification provides a clear and clean method to set deadlines for my work in a structured manner. I can clearly define tasks which need to be completed, I am currently working on or have been completed already as shown on my Trello Board. 
I have used Trello to set deadlines for completing the 4 outcomes and for the necessary work on building my website. I have allocated sections for the design of my website and the subsequent checks needed to ensure the function of my website is as I wish it to be. 
Trello also has an added benefit in that it supports multiple users and so project management for a group project is aided through the collaborative nature of detailing one's work on Trello.

<div><h2>Outcome 1.4 - Describe the risks that might impact digital projects </h2></div>
<br>
<p>There are various risks associated to digital projects that may result in minor to significant detrimental effects on the project and/or to the business. 
These risks could include cyber security. To illustrate, if an IT user is connected to the wifi or even their company’s Ethernet, it is possible for small to large scale cyber-attacks. These attacks either prevent the user from accessing their information, delete their information or affect the manner in which the user may use their information. Consequently, this risk may impose a delay or increased cost to the project. 
There may also be risks presented due to the hardware used, accessibility and/or quality of the internet connection which could affect the ability to communicate, research or develop a project. To combat these potential problems, one could invest in equipment such as an external hard-drive to free memory on older devices, upload data to cloud storage and backup files on backup external hard-drive(s). 
The risks that might impact digital projects may include problems with hardware, software and expertise of the individual. To illustrate if a relevant party encounters a problem implementing their objective due to difficulties with their resources or ability then competitors may develop the same idea first or the significant delays may affect relations with various stakeholders and/or shareholders. Other risks may include not adapting one’s approach to each project or party, not being fully engaged with the concept or management of the project, being disorganised, missing deadlines and not having an appropriate plan for after the project has been delivered. Another important risk may be the management of personal data. If the project collects, stores, manages and/or uses customer data then they manner in which they do this will be regulated by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

<div><h2>Outcome 1.5 - Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job? </h2></div>
<p>
    It is important to understand the goal of the project, the wishes of the client/individual, the deadlines and resources associated with the project. To illustrate, if the project's aim was to solve quantitative problems for pricing, trade management, and risk management platforms such as those used for investment or hedge fund banking. It is unlikely that HTML and CSS would be the appropriate technologies for the task. One would want to understand the question being asked and use a software such as Python (with or without Numpy), Matlab and/or SPSS to fulfill the objective depending on the information present and objective of the project. 
    It is also important to consider the resources avaiable with respect to how many people are employed for the task, the availability of commercial software such as SPSS, anti-virus packages and the time required to complete the task. Sometimes the optimal method to achieve the goal may not be possible due to limited resources. 
    The software chosen must then meet the specific requirements needed for the task. It could be possible that several software may be used on a trial basis to determine the optimal for the project. 
</p>
<br>
<div><h2>Outcome 1.6 - Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. – How has trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control </h2></div>
<br>
<p>
As mentioned in Outcome 1.3, Trello has allowed me to plan in a clear and structured manner. Git is an open-source version control system.
In the context of my website, this means that upon creation of my website, as I make changes to the code including releasing new versions of the website up to its official release and after the release a version control system such as Git allows for each revisio/modfication to be stored. Allowing the code to be stored in this manner promotes collaboration between developers too as they can download newer versions of the software, modify the code and then upload the most recent revision in a way that allows all developers to view the changes, download them and therefore contribute to the latest code. 
Git is believed to be the most popular version control system for developers due to its numerous advantages over other version control systems such as a more efficient method of storing files and ensuring greater integrity of stored files. Another advantage is the "hub", where projects stored by developers are located and developers may network with other people who may possess similar interests.  

A repository also referred to as "repo" is a location where all the files for a any given project are stored. Each unique project is allocated its own repo which can be assessed with a unique URL. A project may be "forked" when a new developer creates a new project based on an already existing project in the repo. Therefore forking encourages the continual development of programs and projects. 
Upon forking from an existing project with a valuable contribution, the developer may then issue a pull request. A pull request allows for the developer to request to be recognised by the original developer(s) with the potential to be included in the official project or repo. The developers of the original repo are able to see the new work and choose whether to accept the pull request (or not). Therefore, allowing communication between the original authors and the developer. 

Lastly, GitHub is also lauded for its social networking capacity. Projects are often created, grown and completed due to the social networking possibilites. Each GitHub user possesses a personal profile which can be updated to display information akin to a cv e.g. detailing the user's project history and contributions to other projects such as pull requests. Therefore, users with similar interests may connect and collaborate on future projects.

<div><h2>Outcome 1.7 - Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects? </h2></div>
<br>
<p>
The General Data Protection Regulation, also referred to as GDPR is a European Union legislation that regulates the processing of personal data. It came into effect on May 25, 2018 and superseded the previous EU directive passed in 1995 that regulated that area.
One of the primary objectives of GDPR was to change the legal reulations regarding the processing and protecting personal data. These changes are designed to be better suited to the challenges presented by technological development and globilisation that have subsequently facilitated the availability of one's personal data and the opportunity for the pervasive use of personal data. Personal data may refer to any information that may identify an individual such as their name, age, location data, identification number. 
GDPR increases the scope of an individual user's rights and allows for data subjects e.g. users of an online service to possess greater control over the processing of their information. Therefore, this allows the user to possess a deeper insight into how the information concerning them is stored, how it is used and provides them with the ability to restrict or completely prohibit the processing of their data. 
Therefore, companies including companies focussing on digital projects are required to comply with the GDPR. Therefore the way a digital project processes, stores and handles data is regulated by GDPR. The image of a digital project may also be affected by GDPR too. For example, if the project fails to implement the necessary and appropriate security measures required to ensure the correct processing, storage and protection of data, then they increase the risk of a data breach. It may be compulsory that the communication of a data breach to the relevant supervisory body and the users affected by the breach may be required upon a data breach occuring. Therefore compliance to the GDPR is key. Companies may be penalised upon non-compliance with GDPR with the most severe punishments being an administrative fine of up to EUR 20,000,000 or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher. That may cause a real harm for both small and large-size companies.

Other legal constraints and guidelines that may affect digital companies are the protection of one's intelluctual property and copyrighting any original work through the digital medium.
