    The scenario reads
  </b>
  <i>
    Now you have setup your blog, it’s time to get into the detail.
You now need to critically review your website. To the bottom of your website add a review section that contains the following information.
  </i>
</p>
<br>
<br>
<div>
  <h2>Outcome 2.1 - Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed
  <i>
    – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? <i>E.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello
  </i> 
</h2>
</div>
<br>
<p>
I have been happy overall with the tools that I used to make my website. For the coding and function of the website I used Visual Studio Code (VSC). VSC is easy to use, allows for the integration of git, integrates the console terminal and its memory consumption is low. I also appreciate that VSC includes a superior tooling for web technologies such as HTML and CSS in comparison to other code editors. 
I am a novice at web design and having a platform that provides a clear view of my code syntax and modifications is a great tool in aiding my development in coding and web design. 
Trello also benefitted me in allowing me to clearly plan and structure the way in which I wanted to design my website and meeting specific deadlines needed to complete the webpage. 
</p>
<div>
  <h2>
  Outcome 2.2 - Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate 
  <i>
    E.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello
  </i>
  </h2>
</div>
<br>
<br>
<p>
  I believe the tools I used: primarily VSC and Trello were appropriate. Both of these platforms are easy to install and use. Therefore  users with very little experience ranging to professionals can easily use VSC to code. The Trello board with the Kanban add-on facilitated planning and structuring the website design and content in an easy way. I would recommend these platforms for users of all levels and would use these platforms again. 
</p>
<br>
<div>
  <h2>
  Outcome 2.3 - Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project 
  <i>
    Are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?
  </i>
</h2>
</div>
<br>
<p>
I am relatively happy with my website. I believe that the content directly addresses the questions set. However, aesthetically I would have liked to have been able to perform more. This has been my first time coding with HTML and CSS and I would have appreciated being given more time to explore methods of design in HTML/CSS. In addition, I would have chosen to have perform smaller tasks before completely designing my own page which contains several tabs. 
</p>
<br>
<div>
  <h2>
    Outcome 2.4 - Describe further improvements you can make to your project
  </h2>
</div>
<br>
<p> I would improve the tabulated section at the top whereby each page/tab is shown. Rather than have a block, I would have liked it to be colour coded for each section. Similarly, I would also have liked to have shown the scrolling bar going across the colour spectrum (roygbiv). 
</p>
<div>
  <h2>
  Outcome 2.5 - Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose
  </h2>
</div>
<br>
<p>The outcomes presented throughout this website are directly in response to the questions asked in Outcome 1, Units: 1, 2 and 3 and Outcome 1. To illustrate, the function of my website is in agreement with my HTML and CSS code. The navigation bar scrolls alongside the text and the links to each section of the webpage correctly show the title and are appropriate labelled and placed. The images included for the background and as an icon clearly demonstrate what they are supposed to without any errors.
