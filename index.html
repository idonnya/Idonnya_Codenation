    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>Hi all. I am Idonnya. I recently finished my PhD in Musculoskeletal Sciences at UCL and am awaiting my PhD viva (thank you covid-19!). 
    I also studied my MSC I and II at The CRI (Paris Descartes & Paris Diderot) whereby I was afforded the opportunity to work on various projects globally including UFRJ in Rio de Janeiro and the MIT, Boston, USA.
  
    Despite having a training in medical sciences and medicine, I am deeply interested in the law and am tranisition from academia to commercial (or human rights law). To aid my progression, especially with regards to commerce and banking, I want to learn and develop my coding skills to marry well with my abilities in statistics. I am of proud mixed heritage: Jamaican, Nigerian and Black British.

    <h3> My Interests</h3>
    <p>
    I am also very sporty. I previously played football for Nottingham Forest Ladies and Leicester City Ladies. I also represented my country at the 100m and 200m sprints. A few years ago I began learning my first martial art: Capoeira and have not looked back since. I train Capoeira 3 times a week.
    In additon to this I also train Krav Maga and gymnastics (tumbling & tricking). I'm hoping that I do not age so I can continue to do loads and progress!</p>
