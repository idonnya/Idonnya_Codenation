        Outcome 1.1 - Describing the content and layout for each page
    </h2>
</div>
<br>
<p>
The content and layout of my index page (about me), unit 1 outcomes 1, 2 and 3 and unit 2 outcome 1 all possess a similar content and layout. The content page has a rainbow background with each page presented as a hyperlink in black font. There is a hover function for each page link whereby a gold box is shown highlighting all page links and hyperlinks.  
There is a banner on each page that displays an image. Beneath this there is a black background and all written text is displayed in either yellow font - headers or white font - answers to text. 
The contact me page features the same page links, header and coloured background. However, the main difference is that text boxes are present that allow the user to input their information.

        Outcome 1.5 - Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites
    </h2>
</div>
<br>
<p>
Contraints that may affect websites include: 
<br>
<b>
    Copyright
</b>
<br>
Provided that a website is an original work, websites and their content are inherently protected from copyright, one of the reasons why the majority of websites display a "Copyright 2018" statement usually in the footer. This statement may deter the contents of a website being copied by other users. Therefore, when creating a website, the designer needs to be careful of copying or passing off the contents of another website as its own.  
To ensure that the authors of a respect the copyright belonging to the authors of another website and exert their own right to copyright, they should ensure that any images displayed on the page are copyright free or licensed images, detect other websites that may be infringing on their website and protect their own website from copyright. 
<br>
<b>
    The identify of the business 
</b>
<br>
 If the website is for a business, The Companies Act 2006 states that spefic criteria relating to the identity of the company must be disclosed on the website. This information must include the company name, company registered number, place of registeration and the postal address, company email and phone number(s) as well as other information. Usually, this information is located on the Contact Us or About Us page of a website. 
<br>
 <b>
     Adherence to GDPR regulations
 </b>
<br>
The website must give the user the right to grant consent regarding the use of their data. The user must be informed how their data will be accessed, processed, stored and making it easy for the user to withdraw their consent.
<br>
<b>
    Your company policies, procedures and consumer protection
</b>
<br>
The website must include details regarding the personal information the website (for a business) collects and how this information is used (a privacy policy), a cookie disclosure stating how the website uses cookies and a disclaimer clarifying how the information on the website may be used by the user and the liability of the business. 
Consumer protection is relevant if the a buisness chooses to sell items on their website. 
<br>
<b>
    Accessibility
</b>
<br>
To be compliant with the Equality Act 2010, the website must be accessible to all who may use and/or need it.

        Outcome 1.6 - Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them
    </h2>
</div>
<br>
<p>
    To be compliant with the Equality Act 2010, the website must be accessible to all who may use and/or need it. Therefore, the website must at least meet level AA of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1), the website must also be compatible with commonly used assistive technologies such as screen readers, screen magnifiers and speech recognition tools. 
    <br>
    The testing process of the website must also include people with disabilities during the collection of user data and must contain an accessibility statement on the website. 
    The use of alt tags - the words that become apparent upon hovering over an image may aid users with a visual impairment and/or those that use a screen reader. The use of subtitles and transcripts may also be used to ensure the website is accessible for all. Using full stops for abbreviated words such as B.B.C. instead of BBC so that the screen reader may recognize the word is an abbreviation instead of phonetically reading it. Other measures to increase the accessibility of the website include describing each link used, using smart colour choices instead of loud, garish colours or those that may affect colourblind users, having a wide area for clickable links to aid users with mobility issues and to include an accessibility guide.

    <h2>
        Outcome 1.7 - Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites
    </h2>
</div>
<br>
<p>
There are numerous file types that may be used for websites. Currently, the most commonly used browsers support many file types. Therefore, it is important to define which file type will be most compatible for your website and browser of choice. For example, using the wrong file type for an image such as a logo may affect the way that the image is shown on the website. Consequently, the way in which the image is viewed may not be as intended. In addition, incorrect file types may also negatively affect the page speed.

To illustrate using images as an example. Images are made up of either raster or vector file types. Raster images are comprised of a series of pixels wheras vector files are comprised using proportional formulas. The majority of photographs shown on websites are raster images and will be saved as a PNG, JPEG or GIF file. Whereas, bector images are much more complex and usually are saved as a SVG file type. Vector images are also renouned for not being able to work will with photographs and tend to be the file type of choice for graphics that require frequent resizing such as those used for logos. 

The appropriate file type for websites may include: AVI | .CSS | .DOC | .EXE | .GIF | .HTML/ .HTM | .JPG/ .JPEG | .MID/ .MIDI | .MP3 | .MPG/ .MPEG | .MOV/ .QT | .PDF | .PNG | .RAM | .RAR | .TIFF | .TXT | .WAV | .ZIP 
<b>
    Photo/Images

Websites may want to incorporate images such as jpeg, tif or gif files.
