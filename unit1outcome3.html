    <h2>
        Outcome 3.1 - Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency.
        <i>
            Could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?
        </i>
    </h2>
</div>
<br>
<p>
I believe that I could have been more efficient in creating my website. I could have set more strict deadlines in completing the answers to the each outcome and adhered to them. This would have allowed me more time to do more researching regarding the layout of the website and how to code them e.g. having a rainbow themed scroll bar and colour coding aspects of the webpage such as the links to each page/site. I would also have organised my index page/introductory page in a different way. 
If this assignment, a team leader would need to be appointed. The team leader would not necessary be required to have the most coding experience, however, would be required to ensure that all members of the time can fulfill their function and meet each deadline. Subsequently, the website could first be divided in terms of the content needed for each section and the team would have to agree a clear concept for the website's design to maximse the appearance of the website and indeed the content itself.

        Outcome 3.2 - Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency
    </h2>
</div>
<br>
<p>
Apportioning time for research and defining the key concepts of the website such as design, content and timeframe may help the efficiency of the process and productivity. 
If the concept is clear this facilitates breaking down the overall goal into specific tasks and objectives. These can be divided into small and large tasks. Each time should have a realistic estimate of the duration it may take to complete the task. Therefore, can set clear, achievable objectives each day that will allow them to finish the task according to the deadline. 
To improve productivity and efficiency, it is also important to take breaks. One can not maintain a given level of concentration throughout prolonged periods and so breaks are necessary to keep one engaged and stimulated. 
If it is possible to delegate tasks to an appropriate person, then this is a means to increase productivity and efficiency too. In addition, it is important that appropriate support channels are available to ensure that if an individual requires help or assistance to complete a task, they are able to acquire this help within a timely manner to reduce the negative impact on the completion of a task.
Ensuring that you and/or collaborators have the correct tools, equipment and working environment prior to the start of the task is also important to maximise productivity and efficiency. In turn, reducing distractions such as irrelevant google searches or social media visits can also improve productivity and efficiency.

        Outcome 3.3 - Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects

            what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?

</div>
<br>
<p>
I would definitely conduct more research of webpages with a similar design to my intend concept. This would have allowed me to explore the means in which I could implement these ideas into code. Such as adding sounds to the webpage. Developing a webpage as a team may also have improved productivity and it would have been something I would have liked to try.
The outcomes and questions were already defined prior to be distributed to us, therefore in our team we could have assigned sections according to confidence and ability of the team member. Discussions could be held on Zoom and Slack such as vocal calls, video calls and team channels/group messaging. This way, communication may be held between all members in a manner that is convenient and motivates the individual to complete their task as opposed to serving as a distraction. 
Each member would be required to have their input into the code too such as the organisation of the text, the navigation bar, images required for the page and the background.

    <h2>
        Outcome 3.4 - Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions
    </h2>
</div>
<br>
<p>
There are various aspects to consider when testing a digital solution. These include having a clearly defined demographic for the digital platform. Different age groups, individual's located in different geographical locations and of different ages may have different access to devices and connection to the internet so one would have to bear this in mind when developing a solution. 
Also the performance of the digital solution may be affected if it has not been tested on different browsers and/or different devices. 
It is important to test the functionality of the platform too such as the capability for the user to reset the password if required, printing, copy/pasting of the page and the storage/processing of user information. 

First and foremost I would define, plan and document the testing and quality assurance process. I would possess a quality management plan, an optional document that defines the acceptable level of quality of the product and details how the project will achieve this requirement. I would ensure that all testing criteria are met and then seek individuals to test the platform. 
One method could be to outsource the testing to software engineers or users on github whereby essential modifications may be identified and made.
